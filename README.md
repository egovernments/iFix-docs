# iFIX

## Introduction

iFIX is an information exchange infrastructure \(similar to highways\) that will facilitate exchange of fiscal information across central, state and local governments and also between various departments in a standardized manner.  It is being developed as a open public digital good \(PDG\) which can be leveraged by any government. 

iFIX facilitates exchange of information through a standard set of API \(Application Program Interfaces\)  and events that are available in the [Standards](platform/standards/) section.

iFIX provides standard APIs for management of master data like Departments, Funds, Chart of Accounts, Expenditure \(e.g. Schemes, Non-Scheme\) and Projects. Client systems can register into iFIX and based on the permissions granted use the APIs to manage the master data and/or post primary fiscal events e.g. Demand, Receipt, Bill, Payment. FIX then makes this information available through Standard API for in aggregated and dis-aggregated form for other systems to query and leverage.
