# iFIX

## Introduction

FIX is an information exchange infrastructure \(similar to highways\) that will facilitate exchange of fiscal information across central, state and local governments and also between various departments in a standardized manner.  It is being developed as a open public digital good \(PDG\) which can be leveraged by any government. 

FIX facilitates exchange of information through a standard set of API \(Application Program Interfaces\)  and events that are available in the [Standards](platform/standards/) section.

FIX provides standard APIs for management of master data like Departments, Funds, Chart of Accounts, Locations, Programs and Projects. Client systems can register into FIX and based on the permissions granted use the APIs to manage the master data and/or post primary fiscal events e.g. Sanction, Appropriation, Allocation, Transfer, Demand, Receipt, Bill, Payment. FIX then makes this information available through Standard API for in aggregated and dis-aggregated form for other systems to query and leverage.
