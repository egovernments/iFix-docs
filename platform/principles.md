# Principles

The platform is being built as a Digital Public Good and follows a key set of design principles

* Single Source of Truth
  * Data resides in multiple systems across departments and getting an integrated, consistent and disaggregated view of data is imperative.
* Federated
  * Central, State and Local Governments represent the federated structure of government. This federated structure must be taken into cognisance when design systems that enable inter governmental information exchange. 
* Unbundled
  * Break down complex systems into smaller manageable and reusable parts that can evolvable and scale independently.
* Minimum
  * Minimum data attributes which have well defined purpose must be mandatory, everything else should be optional.
* Privacy and Security
  * Ensuring privacy of citizens, employees and users of the systems are protected.
* Performance at Scale
  * The system must be designed to perform at scale.
* Open Standards
  * The system must be based on open standards so that it is easy to comprehend, integrate, operate and evolve.
