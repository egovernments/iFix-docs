# Principles

The platform is being built as a Digital Public Good and follows a key set of design principles

* Single Source of Truth
  * Data resides in multiple systems across departments and getting an integrated, consistent and disaggregated view of data is imperative.
* Federated
  * Central, State and Local Governments represent the federated structure of government. This federated structure must be taken into cognisance while designing systems that enable intergovernmental information exchange. 
* Unbundled
  * Break down complex systems into smaller manageable and reusable parts that are evolvable and scale independently.
* Minimum
  * Minimum data attributes that have a well-defined purpose is mandatory; everything else is optional.
* Privacy and Security
  * Ensuring the privacy of citizens, employees and users while ensuring the system security.
* Performance at Scale
  * The system is designed to perform at scale.
* Open Standards
  * The system is based on open standards so that it is easy to discover, comprehend, integrate, operate and evolve.
