# Installation

## Deployment

The simplest way to get started with the **deployment process** is to manage deployment **configuration as code**. Each service deployment configuration is defined as Helm charts and deployed into the Kubernetes cluster. We can collocate the deployment-as-code as source code, leveraging all the benefits of source control including change tracking and branching, then package it. So below is the source code repo that contains all the deployment-as-code for iFix.

## 3. Deployment-as-code

## 4. Destroy the Setup <a id="5-destroy-the-cluster"></a>

Finally, clean up the cluster Setup if you wish, using the following command. This will delete the entire cluster and other cloud resources that were provisioned for the DIGIT Setup.

```text
cd DIGIT-DevOps/infra-as-code/terraform/my-ifix-eks
terraformdestroyâ€‹
```

## Conclusion <a id="conclusion"></a>

All Done. We have successfully Created infra on Local, Cloud, Deployed iFix into the Kubernetes cluster.
