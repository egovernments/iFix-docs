Users are redirected to this screen after successful login.![](blob:https://digit-discuss.atlassian.net/cdc281ad-7766-457d-b7dc-e66837f96566#media-blob-url=true&id=3bfe62d4-1653-4f5e-b3dd-709a01f7692a&collection=contentId-1923416085&contextId=1923416085&mimeType=image%2Fpng&name=Screenshot%202021-09-16%20at%205.56.04%20PM.png&size=20588&width=327&height=576&alt=)

This screen consists of multiple sections and user interactions.

If the user is mapped to multiple tenants then a dropdown appears. The user can select the desired tenant to proceed further.

Once the user selects the tenant, the features cards are displayed on the screen based on the roles mapped for the selected tenant.

## **Login For First Time**

If the user logs in for the first time a system walkthrough begins automatically.

Else, users can view walkthroughs any time by clicking on the help icon.

### **Logic Implemented for Walkthrough**

![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2875%29.png)

Create a global key for each card.

Create placeholder cards, pointer and description widgets.

On click, the position of the card is determined and the placeholder card appears on the overlay exactly.
