2. Users are able to
   1. Change Language
   2. Edit profile
   3. Logout
3. Changing language changes localization as per standards
4. Edit profile takes users to the next screen where changes can be made to the user profile
   1. Name - Can be changed
   2. Phone number - Cannot be changed
   3. Gender - This field is not present by default. Whatever user enters is stored and saved
   4. Email ID - It is an empty field. User input is stored as the user’s email id
   5. Change Password - This takes users to the password changing screen where the old password, new password and confirm new password has to be entered as per given standards.
      1. Dynamic password validation happens the same as in the registration flow.
      2. Until all fields are entered, the primary CTA is disabled.
      3. Changing the password shows a nudge to the user “Password updated successfully” and closing this nudge takes the user to the user profile screen.
   6. Clicking on save shows a nudge to the user” Details saved successfully”. Upon closing, this user remains on the screen but the fields show as edited.
