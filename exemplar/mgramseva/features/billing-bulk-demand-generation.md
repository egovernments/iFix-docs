# Billing - Bulk Demand Generation

All GPs have a monthly billing cycle for water charges.  The Scheduler automatically triggers on “X” date of every month to generate demand and raise bills for non metered connections.

* Metered connections do not fall under bulk demand generation

1. For the first month of go live, it is only the arrears and no demand is generated and hence no bill to collect payments
2. From the second month \(X date of Month 2\) onwards, demand is generated.
3. Once the demand is generated, a notification is triggered to all mGramSeva users.
   1. Details of Notification
      1. “Demand for water charges has been raised for &lt;GP&gt;. New Bill Amount is Rs. Xyz. Overall pending amount is Rs.AbcD”
4. Each non metered household also get notifications
   1. SMS Notification with Bill PDF
      1. Dear “username”, A new water bill has been generated against &lt;connection ID&gt;. Please download the bill using &lt;link&gt;
   2.  SMS notification with a payment link
      1. Dear “username”, A new water bill has been generated against &lt;connection ID&gt;. Please pay the bill online to avoid late payment charges&lt;link&gt;
5. Revenue collector when on HH Details screen sees a new card \(Updated card from month 2 onwards\) with information related to demand and payment collection.
6. There is also a demand collection Tile/Card on the home screen.
   1. This is used in cases when the scheduler is not run \(due to technical errors\) and GP wants to run it manually.
7. If the manual demand generation is done in the middle of the billing cycle for which demand has already been generated this will do nothing.
   1. Only when the scheduler has not generated a demand for a billing cycle, manual demand generation helps.

For Demand Generation Logic refer to [Bulk Demand Generation for Non-Metered](bulk-demand-generation-for-non-metered.md)
