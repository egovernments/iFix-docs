# Demand/Bill Generation for Metered Connection

For Metered connection, the demand is generated for the Billing period \(defined based on the meter reading date\) that is selected by the user at the time of recording the meter reading. 

The 2 uses cases to be handled are -

1. **First demand generated in system**: The demand would be generated for the selected billing period. The demand period would be from “Previous meter reading date” from the consumer master or the demand created as part of master TO the date entered in the billing screen. The arrears are tagged to the previous billing period of the current demand, and the period is from the start of FY to the “Previous meter reading date” from the consumer master.
2. **Consecutive demand**: The demand is generated for the period defined based on
   1. From Date: Meter reading date from last demand generated for the Consumer.
   2. To Date: Is the selected meter reading date in the bill generation screen
