# Billing - Metered Connection

Unlike Non-Metered connections which have a billing cycle for demand & bills generated automatically, a metered connection needs more inputs, which helps in volumetric billing.

A revenue collector can see a CTA to “Generate a new Bill” on the HH details screen.

1. Clicking on “Generate a new Bill” takes users to the bill generation screen where new meter reading details are entered
2. Field on bill generation screen for metered connections are displayed in the table below
3. Clicking on “Generate bill” takes the user to the bill generation successful screen
4. Logic for Bill ID number - “RB - dd/mm/yyyy-yy/running\_sequence\_number”
5. On the success screen there are 3 user actions
   1. Download bill - Download bill as PDF \(name of PDF is always the Bill ID by default\)
   2. Share bill on WhatsApp - Share bill as PDF on WhatsApp
   3. Collect Payment - navigates the revenue collector to the payment collection screen
6. Share on WhatsApp opens the WhatsApp share popup with the option to choose contacts/groups. The bill is shared with the below text and attached PDF details -

   Text “ Dear &lt;ConsumerName&gt;, Please find water bill for billing cycle &lt;Cycle&gt; attached as PDF”
